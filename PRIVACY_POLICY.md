# Privacy Policy for LLM Chat assistant

**Last Updated: February 16, 2026**

## Overview

LLM Chat assistant ("we", "our", "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how LLM Chat Assistant handles your data.

## The Short Version

**We collect ZERO data.** Everything stays on your device.

## Data Collection

LLM Chat assistant does **NOT** collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers. Specifically:

- ❌ No personal information collected
- ❌ No usage analytics or tracking
- ❌ No cookies or identifiers
- ❌ No data sent to external servers
- ❌ No third-party services
- ❌ No account registration required

## Local Storage

LLM Chat assistant uses your browser's `localStorage` to save your research notes locally on your device:

- **What is stored:** Your research items (notes, todos, questions) and their content
- **Where it's stored:** Locally in your browser only
- **Who can access it:** Only you, on your device
- **When it's deleted:** When you uninstall the extension or clear browser data
- **Cloud sync:** None - data never leaves your device

## Permissions Explained

LLM Chat assistant requests the following permissions:

### `storage`
- **Why:** To save your research items locally in your browser
- **Scope:** Local storage only, no cloud or external access

### `scripting`
- **Why:** To inject the LLM Chat Assistant sidebar on supported websites
- **Scope:** Only on Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and Gemini domains

### `activeTab`
- **Why:** To detect which chat/project you're viewing
- **Scope:** Read-only access to URL and page context

### Host Permissions
- **Domains:** claude.ai, chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com, gemini.google.com
- **Why:** To enable text selection capture and sidebar injection
- **What we access:** Page content for text selection; page structure for sidebar injection
- **What we DON'T access:** No authentication tokens, no messages sent to external servers

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- **You control access:** Data is protected by your device's security
- **No data breaches possible:** We don't have servers to be hacked
- **Export control:** You can export data as JSON anytime
- **Deletion control:** You can delete all data by uninstalling the extension

## Third-Party Services

LLM Chat Assistant does **NOT** use any third-party services, including:

- ❌ No analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
- ❌ No error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No CDNs for code
- ❌ No external APIs

## AI Platform Integration

LLM Chat Assistant works alongside Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini but:

- **Does NOT** access your chat history beyond what's visible on screen
- **Does NOT** intercept or modify your conversations
- **Does NOT** send your data to these platforms
- **Only reads** selected text when you explicitly choose to capture it

## Children's Privacy

LLM Chat Assistant does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any data at all, COPPA compliance is inherently maintained.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

If we ever change how data is handled (e.g., adding optional cloud sync), we will:

1. Update this privacy policy
2. Update the extension version
3. Notify users through the extension update notes
4. Require explicit opt-in for any data collection features

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) are moot. However:

- **Access:** You always have full access to your data (it's in your browser)
- **Export:** Use the export button to download your data as JSON
- **Deletion:** Uninstall the extension or clear browser storage
- **Portability:** Exported JSON can be imported anywhere

## Compliance

This privacy policy complies with:

- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - by design, as we collect no data
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) - by design, as we collect no data

## Legal Basis

The legal basis for processing data (local storage) is **legitimate interest** - specifically, providing the core functionality of the extension that you explicitly installed and use.

## Open Source
